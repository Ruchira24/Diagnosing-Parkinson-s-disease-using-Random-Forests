# Diagnosing-Parkinson-s-disease-using-Random-Forests

Using classification algorithms and Ensemble techniques to diagnose Parkinson’s Disease (PD) using the patient voice recording data


This project involved using classification algorithms and Ensemble techniques to diagnose Parkinson’s Disease (PD) using the patient voice recording data. 
I have built the following models: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, Ensemble model - Random forest, Bagging, Boosting 
and a Meta Classifier.
I had compared all models based on of accuracy to finalise the model for prediction.
